# Introduction

Whoever designs and builds message-based distributed systems made of stateful services needs to acknowledge and cope with two basic facts of reality i.e. **at-least-once message delivery** and **lack of transactions** between state managed by the service and the messaging infrastructure  (* - this is not some universal ). This site gathers knowledge on approaches used in the industry to cope with these problems. It targets both specialized audience i.e. people building infrastructure and frameworks as well as software developers in general that seek information on messaging systems.
