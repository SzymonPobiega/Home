# Introduction

Whoever designs and builds message-based distributed systems made of stateful services needs to acknowledge two basic facts of reality i.e. **at-least-once message delivery** and **lack of transactions** between state managed by the service and the messaging infrastructure  (* - this is not some universal ). 

This site gathers knowledge on approaches used in the industry to cope with these problems. It targets both specialized audience i.e. people building infrastructure and frameworks as well as software developers in general that seek information on messaging systems.

## Content

The content on this site comes from various sources i.e. blog posts, conference presentations, books, research papers and last but not least source code of production software systems. We cite the original source whenever one is know to us. We didn't come-up with most of the content here, however there are parts that are based mainly on our industrial experience.
